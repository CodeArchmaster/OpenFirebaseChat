# OpenFirebaseChat
The ultimate fully featured, customizable, UI-independent, high performant, easy to integrate library with a free Firebase backend-as-a-service

# What? Another Firebase Chat? Why?
I already reached out to most of the authors of Firebase Chat libraries for iOS on GitHub in a hope to join forces and create the ultimate library together.

This is something we can all benefit from.
